## Code Structure

The main components of the implementation are:

- **Game State**: Represented by the `GameState` struct containing the board, current player, and game status
- **Board Representation**: An 8Ã—8 grid where 0=empty, 1=black, 2=white
- **Move Validation**: Functions that determine valid moves by checking in all 8 directions
- **Move Execution**: Functions that create a new game state after a move, including flipping captured pieces
- **Computer AI**: A simple algorithm that chooses the move that flips the most pieces
- **UI Rendering**: Material UI components for displaying the board, pieces, and game status

## Key Functions

- `initGame()`: Sets up the initial game state
- `checkMove()`: Validates moves and identifies pieces to be flipped
- `makeMove()`: Executes a move and updates the game state
- `findValidMoves()`: Finds all valid moves for the current player
- `computerMove()`: Determines the computer's next move

## Future Improvements

Possible enhancements to this implementation:

1. **Advanced AI**: Implement more sophisticated computer strategies
2. **Difficulty Levels**: Allow the player to choose different AI difficulties
3. **Game History**: Add undo/redo functionality
4. **Animation**: Add animations for piece flipping
5. **Customization**: Allow customization of colors and board size
6. **Two-player Mode**: Add option to play against another human
7. **Hints**: Add a hint feature to suggest moves for beginners

## Implementation Notes

The game is implemented using pure functional programming techniques:
- No mutable state (all game state changes create new immutable objects)
- Recursive algorithms for board traversal
- Functional data transformations with map, filter, and fold

This implementation showcases how complex game logic can be expressed cleanly in a functional programming style using Flow9.
